Flask-Migrate: Database not upto date:
---------------------------------------------
flask db stamp head  # To set the revision in the database to the head, without performing any migrations. You can change head to the required change you want.
flask db migrate     # To detect automatically all the changes.
flask db upgrade     # To apply all the changes.


Get/pass data from UI  - Flask request
---------------------------------------------
request.args    :   the key/value pairs in the URL query string
request.form    :   the key/value pairs in the body, from a HTML post form, or JavaScript request that isn't JSON encoded
request.files   :   the files in the body, which Flask keeps separate from form. HTML forms must use enctype=multipart/form-data or files will not be uploaded.
request.values  :   combined args and form, preferring args if keys overlap
request.json    :   parsed JSON data. The request must have the application/json content type, or use request.get_json(force=True) to ignore the content type.

For URL query parameters, use request.args:
    search = request.args.get("search")

For posted form input, use request.form:
    email = request.form.get('email')

For JSON posted with content type application/json, use request.get_json().
    data = request.get_json()


JOURNALCTL
---------------------------------------------
To actively follow the logs as they are being written, you can use the -f flag
sudo journalctl -u <service> -f
